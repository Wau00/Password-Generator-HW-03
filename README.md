# Password-Generator-HW-03

# Description
As hacking and phishing scams become more advanced, many developers take extra precautions to protect their users. One example is the implementation of a random password generator, which prompts the user to select a completely random password when registering on a site or application, reducing the chances of hackers guessing or stealing login credentials.

In this project, we will create our own  random password generator on JavaScript. Our program will generate a random password with specific length and character composition (lowercase, uppercase, symbols). Once the password is generated,  is ready to use.
